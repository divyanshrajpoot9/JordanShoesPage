### Important tags and attributes used are as follows:

This README provides an explanation of common HTML and CSS tags used in web development. Understanding these tags is essential for creating web pages with structured content and styling. This guide serves as a reference for both beginners and experienced developers.
#### HTML Tags:
1. <!DOCTYPE html>

This declaration defines the document type and version of HTML being used, ensuring that browsers render the page correctly. The HTML5 document type is used by modern web pages.
2. <html>

The <html> tag is the root element of an HTML document, encapsulating the entire page's content. It contains two main sections: <head> and <body>.
3. <head>

The <head> section contains metadata about the document, such as the page title, character encoding, linked stylesheets, and more. It doesn't display content on the page.
Common <head> tags:

    <meta>: Provides metadata like character encoding and viewport settings.
    <title>: Specifies the title of the webpage, displayed in the browser's title bar or tab.
    <link>: Links external resources like stylesheets (CSS) and icons.
    <script>: Embeds or links to JavaScript code.

4. <body></body>
The <body> tag contains the visible content of the webpage, including text, images, links, and other HTML elements. It defines the structure and layout of the page's content.
Common HTML tags within <body>:

    <h1>, <h2>, <h3>, <h4>, <h5>, <h6>: Headings of varying levels, where <h1> is the highest and <h6> is the lowest.
    <p>: Represents paragraphs of text.
    <a>: Creates hyperlinks to other web pages or resources.
    <img>: Embeds images.
    <ul>: Defines an unordered (bulleted) list.
    <ol>: Defines an ordered (numbered) list.
    <li>: Represents list items within <ul> or <ol>.
    <div>: A generic container to group and style content.

#### CSS Tags:
1. Selectors
Selectors target HTML elements to apply styles. They can be based on element type, class, ID, or other attributes.

2. Properties and Values
CSS properties specify what aspect of an element to style, and values determine how to style it. Properties and values are paired within curly braces {}.

4. Declarations
A declaration consists of a property and its associated value, separated by a colon. Multiple declarations are separated by semicolons.

5. Classes and IDs
Classes and IDs are used to target specific HTML elements for styling. Classes are indicated by a leading dot . in CSS, and IDs by a leading hash #.

7. External Stylesheets
CSS can be included in HTML documents using an external stylesheet by linking to it in the <head> section of the HTML document. This allows for a separation of content and style, promoting maintainability.

In summary, HTML tags define the structure and content of web pages, while CSS tags (selectors, properties, values) are used to style and format those elements. Combining these elements effectively allows for the creation of visually appealing and well-structured web pages.
